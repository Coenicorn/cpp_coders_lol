# CoderClass 2022 C++

This is my code for CoderClass 2022 C++ hosted by the VU Amsterdam in the Netherlands

While you shouldn't copy code, it can be helpful to look at others' and see how it CAN be done

This repo definitely contains ways the assignments CAN be done, though I don't recommend copying my way of writing code,
as it's pretty cluttered and mostly written late at night lmao
