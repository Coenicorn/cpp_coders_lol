# CoderClass 2022 C++

This is my code for CoderClass 2022 C++ hosted by the VU Amsterdam in the Netherlands

While you shouldn't copy code, I'd very much appreciate a star ;)

### Warning

The .vscode folder contains some linux-specific content, check before your run (things like compiler locations)
The folders for their respective assignments also include executables which are linux-specific, so don't run those I guess
